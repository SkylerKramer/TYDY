TYDY (Toolkit for Yeast Data analYtics) is an open-source web tool designed to analyze enhanced yeast one-hybrid (eY1H), enhanced yeast two-hybrid, and heterodimeric eY1H (HD-eY1H) images generated with a Singer RoToR. Analyses include image processing, colony ranking in single-screen experiments, and statistical comparisons with or without replicates in dual-screen experiments (i.e., those with reference and test screens like the HD-eY1H experiment).
